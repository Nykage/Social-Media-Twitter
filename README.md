# Twitter

[Twitter] is a so-called *"micro-blogging service"*.<br>
Micro-blogging is similar to regular blogging, the only difference is that instead of long posts, the user has a limit as to how many words one post can have.

On Twitter, users can make short posts in form of *"Tweets"* and nowadays Twitter, like most popular social media services, can be accessed through regular browsers, but also through a phone app.<br>
Twitter uses *hashtags (symbol: #)* to let users assign topics to their posts, which then can be found by other users, when they type the same topic in the search bar.

**Twitter is generally one of the most popular social media services and the most popular micro-blogging service.**
