# Login and Registration

The login and registration process on Twitter is, like with most other social media sites, very simple.<br>
Simply visit https://twitter.com/?lang=fi and click on either the __*"Login"* button to log in into your already existing account__, or click on the __*"Sign up"* button to create a new account__.

## Login

All you need to do is put in your account information, like **password and either email or phone number**.

## Registration

**The registration happens in 5 steps**.

First you put in your account name and either phone number or email and in the next step you can choose a few features of Twitter.<br>
You can turn on or turn off that others can find you on Twitter with your email, or if you want to get emails with recommendations and statistics, or if you want Twitter to use your data to have personalized posts on your Twitter page.
After that you finish creating your account and confirm it with a code that you either get on your phone or your email.
